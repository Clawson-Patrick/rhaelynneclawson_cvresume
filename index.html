                            <div class="clearfix"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="intro">Greetings! Education is my life's work and my deepest passion. I truly believe that there is no greater purpose in the world than service to others. As a career educator, I am dedicated to the guiding, mentoring, leading and inspiring
                            of individuals and teams with a desire to learn, grow and progress in any subject, area of interest, or career field.
                            <br />
                            <br /> Currently, I teach introductory Web Development for the Western Maricopa Education Center, Start Coding Program. I have previously taught middle-grades Science, Language Arts, Mathematics and Social Studies.
                            <br />
                            <br />Additionally, I am a serving member of the Arizona Air National Guard. Although I have worn many hats in my military career, I have always felt a great sense of duty to serve others in any capacity.
                            <br />
                            <br /> Furthermore, I have served my community as an instructor for Future Sun Devil Families and for Northern Arizona Universities' Gear Up Summer Leadership Academy, both of which were opportunities to help youth find access
                            to higher education through secondary programs for underserved youth in Arizona.
                            <br />
                            <br /> My wife and I currently reside in north Peoria, AZ with our son and our three dogs.
                            <br />
                            <br /> In my personal time, I enjoy trail running, cycling and cooking. I am an avid reader and am learning to play the guitar. My true joy is spending time with my family, who are all currently serving or retired career educators,
                            traveling, attending various events, or just relaxing in the moutains at our family cabin.

                <p>As a professional educator, it is my responsibility to maintain the highest levels of professional skills along with modern educational best practices. Additionally, the leadership training and experience I have from serving in the military

                    <p>Program design offers opportunities for educators, students and the community to create educational experiences. My aim is to bring resources such as learning theories, research studies and program results, as well as all stakeholder's
                        insights into the program goals, objectives and classroom activities to create a the most relevant educational program possible.

                        matter experts and advisory boards to ensure continuity in my program.

                    <p>It goes without saying that data and education go hand-in-hand. What I thought were once platitudes of my professors and teacher leaders/mentors I now find indispensible in my teaching practice. Data truly drives my instruction, forces
                        me to reflect on student learning, and provides detailed metrics for the efficacy of my lesson delivery, active engagement,and assessments.
